# repo_cpp_practice

This project demonstrates various C++ concepts including:

- Pointer manipulation (including smart pointers)
- STL containers (vectors, maps, sets, lists)
- Custom logging utilities
- Multi-threading examples
- Design patterns (e.g., Singleton implementation)

## Project Structure

- **main.cpp**: The main driver file showcasing examples and using various utility functions.
- **include/**: Contains header files such as:
  - `log.hpp`: Logging utilities.
  - `pointers.hpp`: Custom unique pointer implementation.
  - `stl.hpp`: STL-based functionalities.
  - `multithread.hpp`: Multi-threading examples.
- **log.cpp**: Implementation of logging functionalities.
- **multithread.cpp**: Examples and implementation of multi-threading.
- **makefile**: Build instructions for compiling the project.

## Requirements

- A C++14 compliant compiler (e.g., g++ or clang++).
- Make build system.

## Building the Project

Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```sh
make
```
